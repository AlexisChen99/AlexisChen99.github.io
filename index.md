# Hello
## This is 
### Alexis 

This website `AlexisChen99.github.io` is an _experimental_ website that aims to help me become more **farmiliar** with Markdown. ~~Still, html and css are better than Markdown~~. ***Anyway, this is still a good practice for me to become better with Markdown***. There is a quote: 
> Practice makes perfect. 

Enough of talking about this website. Let's talk a little bit about myself. My name is Alexis and you can see more information about myself by clicking on this [website](https://alexischen99.github.io/). You can also check this [link](#heading-4)


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/AlexisChen99/AlexisChen99.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AlexisChen99/AlexisChen99.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
